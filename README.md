## Metrics & DAX Formulas

###  Revenue
```DAX
Revenue = SUM('Bookings'[BookingAmount])
```
### Occupancy %
```DAX
Occupancy% = DIVIDE(SUM('Bookings'[OccupiedRooms]), SUM('Rooms'[AvailableRooms])) * 100
```
###  ADR (Average Daily Rate)
```DAX
ADR = DIVIDE(SUM('Bookings'[BookingAmount]), SUM('Bookings'[OccupiedRooms]))
```
###  RevPAR (Revenue per Available Room)
```DAX
RevPAR = DIVIDE(SUM('Bookings'[BookingAmount]), SUM('Rooms'[AvailableRooms]))
-- or --
RevPAR = ADR * (Occupancy% / 100)
```
###  Realisation %
```DAX
Realisation% = DIVIDE(SUM('Bookings'[BookingAmount]), SUM('Bookings'[ExpectedRevenue])) * 100
```
### Week-on-Week Change
```DAX
WoW Change = DIVIDE([CurrentWeekValue] - [PreviousWeekValue], [PreviousWeekValue]) * 100
``` 
### DSRN / DBRN / DURN 
```DAX
DSRN = CALCULATE(COUNTROWS('Bookings'), 'Bookings'[Source] = "Direct")
DBRN = COUNTROWS('Bookings')
DURN = CALCULATE(COUNTROWS('Bookings'), 'Bookings'[Status] = "Used")
``` 
###  Cancellation %
```DAX
CancelLation% = DIVIDE(COUNTROWS(FILTER('Bookings', 'Bookings'[Status] = "Canceled")), COUNTROWS('Bookings')) * 100
``` 
### Average Rating
```DAX
Average Rating = AVERAGE('Feedback'[Rating])
```
